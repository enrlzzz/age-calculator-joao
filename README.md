# Age Calculator

This repository contains a simple Java program that calculates a person's age. It takes two integer inputs from the user: a person's **birth year** and the **current year**. The program then calculates and displays their current age, as well as their age in the year 2016, providing a clear example of basic subtraction and user input with the `Scanner` class.
